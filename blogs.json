Avoid hot water, toothpaste, and eating or drinking anything other than plain water while wearing aligners.</p><p>Staying hydrated, carrying an aligner case, and attending regular dental check-ups help ensure smooth and safe treatment.</p><p>At Dhotrad’s Sunny Dental Clinics, aligner treatment is always dentist-supervised to deliver healthy, confident smiles.
