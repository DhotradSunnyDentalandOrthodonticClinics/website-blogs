      "Teeth Jewellery in Hubli | Tooth Gems at Dhotrad’s Sunny Dental Clinics",
    author: "Dr. Ignatius Fernandes",
    fullContent: `
      Teeth jewellery, also known as tooth gems, is a popular cosmetic dental trend that adds a subtle sparkle to your smile. 
      When applied professionally, it is safe, stylish, and completely reversible. At Dhotrad’s Sunny Dental Clinics in Hubli, 
      dentist-applied teeth jewellery enhances your smile without harming your natural teeth. Teeth jewellery involves bonding 
      a small crystal or dental jewel to the surface of a tooth using dental-grade adhesive. The procedure requires no drilling,
      causes no pain, and does not permanently alter your tooth, making it a purely aesthetic cosmetic dental treatment. When done 
      by a qualified dentist, teeth jewellery is safe. Before placement, your tooth health, bite alignment, and oral hygiene are 
      carefully assessed, and only healthy teeth are selected to prevent enamel damage, plaque build-up, or decay. With proper care, 
      tooth gems can last from six months to two years and can be safely removed at any time. Maintaining teeth jewellery is simple—brush 
      gently around the jewel, avoid biting hard foods directly, attend regular dental check-ups, and do not pick or play with the gem. 
      Teeth jewellery is ideal for those seeking a temporary smile enhancement for special occasions, though it is not recommended for individuals 
      with active cavities or gum disease. If you are looking for safe and professional teeth jewellery or tooth gems in Hubli, 
      visit Dhotrad’s Sunny Dental Clinics. Add sparkle to your smile without compromising your dental health. 
      For appointments, contact 9343109693.
